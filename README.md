# Project Overview

This project contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in data analysis and visualization. Each Python file in this project can be run independently and produces a specific output.

# Dependencies

This project depends on the following third-party libraries:

```shell
numpy
matplotlib
```

To install these dependencies, please run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please note that if these dependencies conflict with your current development environment, you may need to use **virtualenv** or **conda** to set up the necessary environment.
